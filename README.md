# DHKeyExchangeProject

Diffie-Hellman Key Generator(1976)
D-H is a specific method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys (generate symmetric keys) over a public channel.
It is commonly used to login to a web, to connect to a server...

It exchange some public variables and combines them with some private variables that are kept hidden,
so the 2 parties (or more) can all create the same secret key.
